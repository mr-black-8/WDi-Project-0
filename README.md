## Norse vs Crosses

My first project completed during the Web Development Immersive course at General Assembly. With two weeks experience in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, we were given a brief to create a game of tic tac toe. The idea of Norse vs Crosses came from my excessive viewing of Vikings prior to beginning the course!

My main goal for this project was to program an unbeatable opponent for single player mode, which I managed to achieve. Hard mode single player can only be a loss or a tie!
